## 📄 About The Project

FocusThis is a simple console application that solves a common problem: when you're rewriting text from a screen onto paper, it's easy to lose your place. The app highlights the current sentence, allowing you to maintain focus and boost productivity.

> **Important:** The project is in **beta** stage. We are actively working on improvements.

### Key Features:
- **🎯 Enhanced Focus**: Never lose the line you're copying again.
- **⚙️ Highly Configurable**: Customize colors and behavior to your liking via a config file.
- **🚀 Lightweight**: Runs right in your terminal, doesn't distract or slow down your system.
- **💻 Cross-Platform**: Should work anywhere Python runs.
